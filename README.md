# Introduction
Hi! This is my PostgreSQL portfolio project that involves working with a business dataset of a cinema 
chain in Germany🎦 

At first, I designed and created a tables in a database, so I can import the dataset 
from CSV files📅. The database stores data related to the cinemas, the screenings they host, and the 
managers responsible for each cinema. You can find a whole SQL file with a code that I wrote to create 
those tables in this folder: [/creating_tables_sql/], I will also discuss it in the next section.

After setting up database & tables and importing the dataset I wrote SQL Queries🔍 to answer 4
analytical & business questions. You can find all 4 SQL files with Queries to answer each of these 
question in this folder: [/queries_sql/]

Let's get into it!
